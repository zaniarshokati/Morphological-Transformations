# Morphological-Transformations
This repository contains a Python implementation of Morphological Transformations using OpenCV.

Introduction
Morphological transformations are a set of image processing operations that process images based on their shapes. They are normally performed on binary images, but can also be used on grayscale images. Morphological operations apply a structuring element to an input image and generate an output image.

Morphological transformations are widely used in image processing for tasks such as noise removal, image smoothing, edge detection, etc.

This repository contains Python code for the following morphological transformations:

. Dilation
. Erosion
. Opening
. Closing
. Gradient
. Top Hat
. Black Hat
